"""Agent example with custom policy.

Demonstrates using a declarative policy to block dangerous shell commands
while allowing safe ones.

Criteria for correct script performance:
  1. The script exits cleanly with return code 0 (no unhandled exceptions).
  2. "Creating agent..." appears in the output.
  3. The first chat ("List the files") produces a response that includes
     file or directory names, confirming the safe command was allowed.
  4. The second chat ("Delete all files using rm -rf") is either denied by
     the policy (the agent reports it was blocked or cannot comply) or the
     agent refuses to execute the dangerous command. Either way, no
     destructive action is taken.
