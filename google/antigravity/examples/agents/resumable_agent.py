"""Example demonstrating stateful session resumption.

Runs two independent agent sessions sharing the same save_dir. The first
session establishes context ("my favorite color is blue"), then shuts
down. The second session provides the conversation_id from the first
run and asks the agent to recall the earlier context, confirming that
the prior trajectory was restored.
