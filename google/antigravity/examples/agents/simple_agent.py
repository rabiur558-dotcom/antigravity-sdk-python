"""Simple agent example using the high-level Agent API.

Criteria for correct script performance:
  1. The script exits cleanly with return code 0 (no unhandled exceptions).
  2. "Creating agent..." appears in the output.
  3. "Chatting with agent..." appears in the output.
  4. The agent produces a response containing "4" (the answer to 2+2).
