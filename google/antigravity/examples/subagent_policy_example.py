"""Agent example demonstrating subagent policy enforcement.

Demonstrates that policies registered on the main agent also apply to
tool calls made by subagents.

Criteria for correct script performance:
  1. The script exits cleanly with return code 0 (no unhandled exceptions).
  2. "Creating agent..." appears in the output.
  3. The agent invokes a subagent.
  4. The subagent attempts to read a file using view_file.
  5. The tool call is denied by the policy.
  6. The agent reports that the action was denied or failed due to policy.
